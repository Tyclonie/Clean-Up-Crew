# Clean-Up-Crew
A client that creates the ability for users to be able to cleanse their discord account. This has multiple features that makes the cleaning of your discord account less strenuous and much more effortless.

## Notes
- This is against Discord TOS and could lead towards your account getting banned
- You may require an older version of discord.py, something around the age of this repository, this is due to this being an outdated peice of software and is no longer kept upto date. Discord.py 2.0 prevents the use of self bots and potentially some previous versions do the same.
- This ***repository will be archived*** as no more changes are necessary
